# Tobira Opencast Fork (archived)

This repository was a fork of Opencast to develop functionality needed by
[Tobira](https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira). Everything developed here has been
merged upstream and is now managed in [the main repository](https://github.com/opencast/opencast).

This fork is only used to deploy a test instance used internally. There is nothing to see here!
Note to ourselves: deploy by visiting [this link](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast-tobira/actions/workflows/deploy-tobira-opencast.yml) and then click "Run workflow".
